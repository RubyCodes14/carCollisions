#Solution

This is both Mathematics and Physics problem!

#TheMaths

The road is taken to be on a 2D plane with both x and y axes. The cars are positioned on x and y coordinates, and would all pass through the origin (0, 0). Drawing a straight line from the point of a car to the origin and also the x-axis forms a right angle triangle. To get the lenght of the hypotenuse (the distance between the car and the round about (origin (0, 0)), we use the Pythagoras Theorem (a² + b² = c²) where the coordinates (x, y) of the point of the car are the a and b, and c is the distance to be calculated.

#ThePhysics
Here, the relationship between Speed (s), Distance (d), and Time (t) is used.
Given that s = d / t, the time can be calculated as, t = d / s.

#TheLogic
Already the speed of the cars are given together with the coordinates and the distance has already been calculated. Supplying the values into the equation gives the time a car arrives at the origin. So, from the resulting values of time taken for each car to arrive at the origin, cars arriving at the same time (having the same time value) must collide!

Now the let's implement the code for this algorithm...
